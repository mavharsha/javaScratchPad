/* Java Lambdas */

Method references and how to use them.

When using method references, you place the object or class that contains the method
before the :: operator and the name of the method follows with out args.

Method references can't be used for all the methods.
It can only be used to replaces a single method lambda expression.

Therefore to use method reference, you need a lambda expression with one method.


There are four types of method references:

A method reference to a static method.
A method reference to an instance method of an object of particular type.
A method reference to an instance method of an existing object.
A method reference to a constructor.


(arg) -> Class.staticMethod(arg)

  can be turned into

Class::staticMethod


findNumbers(list, (i, j) -> Numbers.isMoreThanFifty(i, j))

can be turned into

findNumbers(list, Numbers::isMoreThanFifty)


/* Memory Leaks */

Memory leaks happen when object references that are no longer needed are unnecessarily maintained.
